      (Common-Lisp DIRECTORY returns TRUENAME, which unix CL implementations
       generally understand as the target path).



COMMON-LISP Implementation
==========================

    We'll minimize the  CL implementation  specific  dependencies.
    
    Each task will be implemented in its own UNIX process.
    A server process will listen to the socket, 
    and will fork a new console process of each incoming session.
    
    A pipe between the server process and the console process will be
    establised to allow for the transfer of state (PRENDRE ETAT CONSOLE)
    between the consoles.


Terminal I/O
------------

    Since we don't have several threads, we must do polling I/O.
    
    clisp provide extension functions for raw keyboard input.
    
    ESC --> stop current processing and revert to top-level repl
            (note: execution of a running program could be continued with
            the CONTINUE or ALLER A commands).

    Ctrl-A --> the signal should be recoded asynchronously for the
               ATT() function.

    The only way to implement BOTH these features portably on unix
    without threads seems to be with the use of an embedded virtual
    machine where we could implement virtual threads or at least:
        
        (loop
          (process-input (read-char-no-hang))
          (execute-one-instruction))


    If ESC is mapped to SIGINT, this is caught by clisp as a "User
    Break", ie. system::simple-interrupt-condition, which can be
    handled programmatically with handler-bind or handler-case.


    (catch :exit
      (let ((*status* :out) (counter 1)) (declare (special *status*))
           (handler-bind 
            ((system::simple-interrupt-condition
              (lambda (condition)
                (print (list :interupted *status* counter))
                (decf counter)
                (when (zerop counter) (throw :exit nil))
                nil)))
            (let ((*status* :in)) (declare (special *status*)) (loop)))))

    --> (:INTERUPTED :IN 1) 
    
    
    (catch :exit
      (let ((*status* :out) (counter 1)) (declare (special *status*))
        (handler-case (let ((*status* :in)) (declare (special *status*)) (loop))
          (system::interrupt-condition
           (condition)
           (print (list :interupted *status* counter))
           (decf counter)
           (when (zerop counter) (throw :exit nil))))))

    --> (:INTERUPTED :OUT 1) 


    Conclusion:  Implement ESC with stty -intr ESC  
                 and don't implement Ctrl-A/ATT().
